\begin{itemize}

\item Brief history of TreeRNNs
\begin{itemize}
\item Lx theory suggests should be better than comparable sequence models via compositionality \cite{Partee84,Janssen97}.
\item In practice, results mixed but positive. \citealt{tai2015improved} shows dramatic gains on sentiment analysis using tree-structured models over sequence models. \citealt{li2015tree} shows mixed results. Both of these evaluations are limited to small datasets with only hundreds or thousands of training examples.
\item Larger evaluations have been impossible due to issues of computational efficiency. One aim of this paper is to mitigate these issues to make larger-scale experiments possible.
\item Note, though, that while tree structure can be seen as a bias, simply adding more data within reason may not be enough to get a sequence model to learn without that bias \citealt{bowman2015trees}.
\end{itemize}

\item Speed issues
\begin{itemize}
\item Efficient batched computation is a crucial enabling technology in allowing NNs to be used on large datasets. Since NNs require large datasets to be able to model complex problems like language understanding, this is crucial in NLP.
\item Tree structured neural networks can't be batched. As the schematic in Figure~\ref{fig:batching:bad} indicates, different sentences are assigned different trees, and there is no straightforward way of aligning these trees to synchronize computation in the conventional style of implementation.
\item Our proposed model builds on ideas from transition-based parsing to build a model which implements the same computations as a tree-structured model, but which can be efficiently batched. See Figure~\ref{fig:batching:good}.

\end{itemize}

\item Attention issues
\begin{itemize}
\item The technique of soft attention has proven to be exceptionally effective as a way of training neural network models for tasks like translation \cite{bahdanau2014neural,luong-pham-manning:2015:EMNLP} and natural language inference \cite{rocktaschel2015reasoning}.
\item This paper proposes two complementary extensions of the idea of attention to tree-structured models:
\begin{itemize}
\item Constituent-by-constituent attention, in which each node in the tree of one sentence is given a soft alignment to some node or nodes in a second sentence.
\item The mTreeLSTM, which uses a third tree structured model to accumulate information about the alignment between two sentences into a single feature vector. This builds on the notion of a matching LSTM or mLSTM from \citealt{DBLP:journals/corr/WangJ15b}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{The transition-based sentence model}

\subsection{Intuition: Transition-based parsing}

Our model is based on a formalism adapted from transition-based parsing (\todo{What's a good classic citation for this?}).

\todo{[SB, JG] Brief into to transition-based parsing.}

\subsection{The model}

Our model, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:model:0}, takes the form of a transition-based parser, but it is designed to produce sentence representations given parse structures, rather than producing parse structures as its output, leading to the following differences:
\begin{itemize}
\item The model takes a sequence of transitions (\shift s or \reduce s) as input, rather than incorporating a decision function which chooses which transition to perform at each step.
\item The intermediate representations in the parser, including the representations of the tree structures on the stack, are vectors of a fixed length.
\item The \reduce~operation, which combines two trees or tree nodes on the stack into a single larger tree, is represented using a parametric neural network layer function (in particular, a TreeLSTM layer, after \citealt{tai2015improved}).
\item The intermediate states of the stack and buffer during parsing are stored during training. This makes it possible to learn the parameters of the composition function and the input word representations that are fed into the buffer using backpropagation on an objective function that depends on the final sentence representation that emerges at the head of the stack.
\item A novel tracking LSTM component is added to improve the model's ability to efficiently track the context in which each step is being performed. (\todo{Is this similar enough to anything from Dyer that we should add a citation here?})
\end{itemize}



\input{../model0_fig.tex}

\paragraph{Equivalence with existing models}
If we add no additional features, this model computes the same function as a plain TreeRNN. However, we expect it to be substantially faster than conventional TreeRNN implementations. Unlike a TreeRNN, the Model 0 computation graph is essentially static across examples, so examples of varying structures and lengths can be batched together and run on the same graph in a single step. This simply requires ensuring that the graph is run for enough timesteps to finish all of the sentences. This involves some wasted computation, since the composition function will be run $2N-1$ times (with the output of composition at non-\reduce~steps discarded), rather than $N-1$ times in a TreeRNN. However, this loss can be dramatically offset by the gains of batching, which stem from the ability to exploit highly optimized CPU and GPU libraries for batched matrix multiiplication. \todo{Update.}

\paragraph{The buffer and word representations}

We draw our word representations from the standard 300-dimensional vector package provided with GloVe \cite{pennington2014glove}. We do not update these vectors during training. Instead, we use a learned linear transformation to transform the representation of each input word $\vec{x}$ into a pair of vectors that can be used as inputs to a TreeLSTM composition function:

\begin{equation}
\colvec{2}
    {\vec{h}}
    {\vec{c}}
= W_{\text{wd}} \vec{x}
\end{equation}


\paragraph{The representations in the stack}

In our model, each row of the stack contains a pair of vectors $(h, c)$, which together represent some node in the parse tree of the sentence. Since the \shift~operation simply copies entries from the buffer onto the stack, this means that the word representations in the buffer also have two parts, $h$ and $c$. 

\paragraph{The composition function}

From \citealt{tai2015improved}.

The inputs to the composition function are the representations of the two words or phrases closest to the head of the, $(\vec{h}^1_s, \vec{c}^1_s)$ and $(\vec{h}^2_s, \vec{c}^2_s)$, which are treated as the two children of the tree node whose representation the composition function is constructing. Each vector is of the same dimension $D$.

\begin{gather}
\colvec{4}
    {\vec{i}}
    {\vec{f}_l}
    {\vec{f}_r}
    {\vec{o}}
= \sigma(
W_{\text{iffo}}
\colvec{3}
    {\vec{h}_s^1}
    {\vec{h}_s^2}
    {\vec{e}}
)
\\
\vec{g}
= \tanh(
W_{g}
\colvec{3}
    {\vec{h}_s^1}
    {\vec{h}_s^2}
    {\vec{e}}
)
\\
\vec{c} = \vec{f}_l * \vec{c}_s^2 + \vec{f}_r * \vec{c}_s^1 + \vec{i} * \vec{g}  
\\
\vec{h} = \vec{o} * \vec{c}
\end{gather}

$\vec{e}$ is an optional input argument which is either the empty vector $[]$ or a vector from an external source like the tracking LSTM (see below). $*$ denotes the elementwise product. Each vector-valued variable listed here is of dimension $D$. The values $(h, c)$ represent the local subtree, and both will be placed on the stack during a \reduce~operation.

\paragraph{The classifier}

This paper presents the transition-based sentence model within the context of \textit{natural language inference} (also known as \textit{recognizing textual entailment}), a sentence pair classification task. To classify a sentence pair, a feature vector is first constructed. This feature vector is based on the final representations of each of the two sentences---the representations that appear at the head of the stack for each sentence after the final transition. In particular, the $\vec{h}$ portions of these representations are used. The final feature vector consists of the concatenation of these two vectors, $\vec{x}_{\text{premise}}$ and $\vec{x}_{\text{hypothesis}}$, their difference, and their elementwise product:

\begin{equation}
\vec{x}_{classifier} = 
\colvec{4}
    {\vec{h}_{\text{premise}}}
    {\vec{h}_{\text{hypothesis}}}
    {\vec{h}_{\text{premise}} - \vec{h}_{\text{hypothesis}}}
    {\vec{h}_{\text{premise}} * \vec{h}_{\text{hypothesis}}}
\end{equation}

This feature vector is then passed to a series of two (\todo{Update}) ReLU neural network layers, then passed into a linear transformation, and then finally passed to a softmax layer, which yields a distribution among the three labels.

\subsection{Tracking left context with an auxiliary LSTM}

The tracking LSTM captures left context. \todo{Why?}

The tracking LSTM is a standard LSTM RNN. At each step it takes three vectors as inputs: the top element of the buffer $\vec{h}_b^1$, which would be moved in a \shift~operation, and the two two elements of the stack $\vec{h}_s^1$ and $\vec{h}_s^2$ which would be composed in a \reduce~operation. Its output hidden state at each step is used as the external input to the TreeLSTM composition function for that step.

\subsection{Implementing the transition-based sentence model}

\paragraph{The size of the stack}
The size of the stack should be $N$ for sentences of $N$ words, in case the first reduce merges the final two words. The size of the buffer should be $N$.

\paragraph{Converting parses to transition sequences}

For Models 0--3, all training data must be parsed in advance into an unlabeled binary constituency tree. In addition, Model 0 requires that  parses be available at test time as well. For both SST and SNLI we use the parses included with the corpus distributions whenever parses are needed. 

For model 0, training data can be prepared by linearizing the provided parse, then deleting left brackets and replacing right brackets with \reduce~instructions. That is demonstrated here with the example sentence \ii{the cat sat down}:

\begin{quote}\small
( ( the cat ) ( sat down ) )$\Rightarrow$\\
the cat \reduce~sat down \reduce~\reduce
\end{quote}

The input for models 1--4 is simply the word sequence from the parse, with the first two words moved into the stack. The syntactic supervision labels for models 1--3 are simply a binarized version of the Model 0 inputs, with the first two tokens (which are necessarily \shift~\shift) omitted: 

\begin{quote}\small
( ( the cat ) ( sat down ) )$\Rightarrow$ \\
stack: $\langle$the, cat$\rangle$\\
buffer: $\langle$sat, down$\rangle$\\
ops: \reduce~\shift~\shift~\reduce~\reduce
\end{quote}


\paragraph{Handling overly long sentences}

To efficiently implement batched computation, we must stipulate a fixed number of transitions (50) that the model can perform before producing an output. 

\todo{[SB] Why cropping is sensible if done well.}\\

\paragraph{Representing the stack in memory} Or, thin stack. 
\todo{[JG] Explain.}

\paragraph{Optimization and hyperparameters}

We used random search to tune \todo{[SB] List tuned hyperparameters.}

We trained each model for 250k steps, using a minibatch size of 64 for each step. We tracked each model's performance on the development set during training and saving parameters when this performance reached a new peak. We used early stopping, evaluating on the test set using the parameters that performed best on the development set.

\paragraph{Software infrastructure} We will make Theano code available.

\section{Attention over trees}

\input{../tree_attn_fig.tex}

\paragraph{Constituent-by-constituent attention}
We aim to build on the results of \citealt{rocktaschel2015reasoning} and \citealt{wang2015learning}, who find that neural soft attention models is an extremely effective technique for learning natural language inference. In particular, both papers use versions of word-by-word entailment, in which a latent alignment is learned from every word in the hypothesis to one or more words of the premise. We propose to borrow this basic idea, but to adapt it to a tree-structured setting, proposing \textit{constituent-by-constituent} attention. While these models do attention over a matrix $\mathbf{Y}$ of word-in-context representations from the premise encoder, we will perform attention instead over our own primary data structure, $\mathbf{Y}^{st}$, the matrix of vectors that have appeared at the top of the stack during premise encoding, which correspond one-to-one to the constituents in the tree structure representing the premise. Similarly, while the previous models perform one instance of soft attention conditioned on each word in the hypothesis, we perform one instance of soft attention conditioned on each stack top in the hypothesis encoder, representing the constituents of the hypothesis tree.

In our model, attention is performed at each step $t$ of the premise encoder. At step $t$, the query vector that drives attention will be $S^t_0$, the top of the stack.

\section{Experiments}

\paragraph{The Stanford Natural Language Inference task} 
We evaluate our model on the Stanford Natural Language Inference task \cite{snli:emnlp2015}. 

550k/10k/10k split

We skip unlabeled examples.

\todo{[SB] Pull out an example from SNLI.}

We evaluate five models on the SNLI task. Each uses 150d hidden states: 
\begin{itemize}
\item A baseline LSTM model (similar to that of \citealt{snli:emnlp2015}) that uses the same classifier architecture as our models, but encodes sentences using a single layer LSTM RNN sequence model.
\item The unaugmented transition-based sentence model.
\item The transition-based sentence model with the tracking LSTM.
\item The transition-based sentence model with the tracking LSTM and sequence-based attention over premise states.
